Description: printer driver for PDF writing via CUPS
 CUPS-PDF provides a PDF Writer backend to CUPS. This can be used as a
 virtual printer in a paperless network or to perform testing on CUPS.
 .
 Documents are written to a configurable directory (by default to ~/PDF)
 or can be further manipulated by a post-processing command.
 .
 Note that AppArmor prevents outputting PDF documents to non-default
 directories so </etc/apparmor.d/usr.sbin.cupsd> must also be edited,
 whenever the above default get changed in </etc/cups/cups-pdf.conf>.
 .
 In cases where the system mounts home directories from paths other
 than </home/${USER}>, edit </etc/apparmor.d/tunables/home> instead.
 .
 Desktop users might find it simpler to use the Print To File feature
 provided by GTK+ and QT or the LibreOffice's Export to PDF feature.
