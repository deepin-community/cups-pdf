CUPS-PDF for Debian
-------------------
This Debian package of CUPS-PDF is configured as follow:

 * Log files are created by group "lpadmin" to match CUPS permissions.
 * Anonymous Samba output to </var/spool/cups-pdf/ANONYMOUS/> directory.
 * Standard user output to <${HOME}/PDF/> directory.

The settings are fully configurable by editing </etc/cups/cups-pdf.conf>
using the system administrator's favorite text editor.

   CAVEAT

   AppArmor prevents outputting PDF documents to non-default directories
   so </etc/apparmor.d/usr.sbin.cupsd> must also be edited, whenever the
   above defaults get changed in </etc/cups/cups-pdf.conf>.

   In cases where the system mounts home directories from paths other
   than </home/${USER}>, edit </etc/apparmor.d/tunables/home> instead.

   AppArmor issues appear in 'dmesg' in a format similar to this:

   audit[11578]: AVC apparmor="DENIED" operation="mknod" 
   profile="/usr/lib/cups/backend/cups-pdf"
   name="/home/username/unexpectedpath/document.pdf"
   pid=11578 comm="gs" requested_mask="c" denied_mask="c"
   fsuid=1000 ouid=1000

The optional GTK package <system-config-printer> is capable of detecting
this CUPS backend as a suitable ready-to-use printer.

NOTES

 * Follow these instructions for debugging and reporting printing issues:
   <https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DebuggingPrintingProblems>

 * CUPS-PDF.PPD is the only recognized backend since 2.4.7 and this is a
   feature intended to reduce confusion for the end-user. If you require
   paper sizes not supported by CUPS-PDF.PPD, please file a bug report.

 * This package is never affected by Poppler or XPDF bugs; only external
   tools used to generate the PDF might be. Therefore, avoid filing bugs
   related to those codebases against CUPS-PDF.

 * No upgrade of the PDF queue from previous releases is ever attempted.
   If necessary, issue the following command to manually do this:

   sudo lpadmin -p PDF -o pdftops-renderer-default=pdftocairo"

   The above reconfigures the queue named PDF to use the Cairo backend.
   See Debian Bug #928738 for details.
